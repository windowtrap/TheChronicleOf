          In the year 3000, what happens when all the histories of the world come crashing together.
          <br>
          As the information age shifts into high gear, it will keep rising, consuming and obscuring the Sun</span>
        <br>
        <span style="color:#ed7d31">
          The sun will set in a few days. Then our whole system will go dark</span>
        <br>
        The cataclysmic apocalypse referred to in the scriptures of every holy book known to mankind,
        <br>
        Where global monetary systems disintegrated, leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of overcooked rice.
        <br>
        <span style="color:red">
          What happened
          <br></span>
        generations of polluters were punished for their sins
        <br>
        <span style="color:green">
          Within the stratospheric, stratospheric voice of unbound freefalling particles destabilize every remaining government institution and inaugurate a new era of chaos, paranoia, and violencefree
          <br></span>
        Bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax-dodging corporations wrecked havoc
        <br>
        <span style="color:green">
          While here in havoc's mutant-free zones the people still slept.
          <br></span>
        Pissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless & gutless system, where the rich got richer and the poor got fucked over and out
        <br>
        <span style="color:green">
          We want to get fucked over and out of this system,
          <br>
          fucked over and out the door.

        I unleashed total worldwide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust.
        <br>
        <span style="color:red">
          This is the terrible news
          <br></span>
        Nothing but vicious, cannibalistic, mutated, radiating, and horribly disfigured hordes of satanic killers, left in its torturous wake
        <br>
        <span style="color:green">
          The injured and the psychotomimetic hear clearly in the darknoise
          <br></span>
        Massive earthquakes cracked the planets crust like a hollow eggshell
        <br>
        Causing unending volcanic eruptions,
        <br>
        <span style="color:green">
          We look out at the networks of exchange that pervade our lives from every angle from the sky.

          fixed in an ever moving system the last thing to boil over was hope.
