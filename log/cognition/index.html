<br>

<i>The chronicle of < cognition > </i> (2022-2023) is a collaborative project tracing histories of human and non-human cognition through a series of live events, online contributions and a large-scale wall work. 
<br>
With an emphasis on neurodiversity in Aotearoa, <i>The chronicle of < cognition > </i> addresses how the topic of cognition inherently intersects with global discussions concerning white supremacy, disability, gender, sexuality, animal rights, biodiversity and artificial intelligence. Each contributor is asked to present a narrative that situates this discussion in relation to key events or shifts in a variety of fields such as science, technology, policy, activism, art, film and literature.
<br>
<br>
<i>The chronicle of < cognition > </i> is produced in partnership with Te Tuhi as part of the 2023 exhibition <i> who can think, what can think </i> and is supported with funding from Creative New Zealand.
